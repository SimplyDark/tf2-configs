	How to install: 
	
		Extract the ToonHUD.zip file (contains toonhud folder)
			
				Windows:
				
					Move toonhud folder to
				
					C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom 
					
					(remove "(x86)" if you are using 32-bit Windows)
					
				Mac OS:
				
					Use the "Go" option on the command bar and insert
					
					~/Library/Application Support/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf
					
					Create 'custom' folder if it does not exist already
					
					Move toonhud folder inside the custom folder
					
				Linux:
				
					Open path
					
					~/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/common/Team Fortress 2/tf
					
					Create 'custom' folder if it does not exist already
					
					Move toonhud folder inside the custom folder


			If your screen aspect ratio is 4:3 or 16:10:
			
			- Go to toonHUD/Overrides/4;3 aspect ratio (or 16;10 aspect ratio) folder
			- Copy its content to toonhud folder -> Copy and replace

			Do this before you install any other overrides!
			
			After you have installed all the overrides you want, delete Overrides folder!
